            <h3>READING</h3>
            <p>I love reading books in my free time.
            Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is one of my favorite author. 
            Adichie inspires me because she uses her work to inspire women around the world.
            Authors like Wole Soyinka, Buchi Emecheta, Ben Okri, Arese Ugwu have also inspired me.
            Besides novels and books, I also read magazines.
