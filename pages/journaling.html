            <h3>JOURNALING</h3>
            <p>I love journaling. This is simply an act of keeping record of personal thoughts, feelings, insights, and more.
            I started journaling as a kid by writing down my memories and since then it has become a part of me.
            Journaling has helped me in so may ways. It has helped me reduced anxiety. It has also helped me understand a difficult situation better and many more.
