            <h3>DRAWING</h3>
            <p>
            I started drawing when I was a kid. 
            I liked to portray on a sheet of something beautiful, plants, animals, and sometimes humans.<br>
            Now, I draw something that brings the attention of art lovers from around the world. 
            This made me learn to draw from different websites, tutorials, and instructors on YouTube.
